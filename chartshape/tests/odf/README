This is a collection of automated unit tests for loading ODF chart documents.

Whenever you commit code that touches ODF-related functionality, do consider
adding to an existing test or writing a new test. It will save you a lot of
trouble - that trouble being me cracking the whip at you develish as I am if
I find that one of your commits causes a regression without me being able to
reproduce what your commit was supposed to fix in the first place.

===========================================
Quick Guide to Writing an ODF Unit Test
===========================================
1) Find a document you want to base the test on (it must be ODF)

2) Find a name for your new test, e.g. IHateWritingUnitTestsButIAmAfraidYourGonnaWhipMe

3) Use the script 'create-test' from the directory of this README to create the unit test from
   your original document by issuing
   $ ./create-test /path/to/mydoc.odt name-of-unit-test

4) Add copyright notices to TestLoading.h and TestLoading.cpp
